# About

Pieshell is a Python shell environment and library that combines the
expressiveness of shell pipelines with the prower of python iterators.

# Examples

    >>> from pieshell import *

Piping in and out of iterators and between commands:

    >>> env.ls("-a") | env.grep("-e", "io")
    iterio.py
    iterio.pyc
    >>>

    >>> ["foo", "fio", "biob"] | env.grep("-e", "io")
    fio
    biob
    >>>

    >>> for x in ["foo", "fio", "biob"] | env.grep("-e", "io"):
    ...   print 'a' + x
    ... 
    afio
    abiob
    >>> 

Useless use of cat:

    >>> ["foo", "fio", "biob"] | env.grep("-e", "io") | env.cat()
    fio
    biob
    >>>
